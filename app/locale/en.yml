    before: "My name is Silvia, a 36 years old from Barcelona who move to Berlin, Germany a while a go. Since the early days of my life I’ve been fascinated by fashion and crafting clothing, while mostly experimenting with yarn, I’ve work also on several other projects. Being lucky enough to work for a while in my passion, I’ve never stop hacking stuff for myself, friend and family while at home."

In this website you will see my most recent projects, going from helmet therapy cover shells to other nice baby apparel.  Contact me if you’re interested to know more about them."
